System requirements:
  A platform where the MIPS Toolchain is supported (Linux only?)

       https://dmz-portal.imgtec.com/wiki/Gnu_Bare_Metal_Toolchain
     Note that the toolchain is built for x86-64 (amd64). If you want to run
     it on another platform, you can use qemu-user-static.
  2. Navigate to your rtdsr directory and run:
       make

For instructions on how to run the compiled utility, see the README file.
